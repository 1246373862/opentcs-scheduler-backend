/**
 * Manages resources used by clients (vehicles) to help prevent both collisions and deadlocks.
 * <p>
 * Every client usually interacts with the <code>Scheduler</code> according to the following
 * workflow:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * Initially, the client calls
 * {@link #allocateNow(org.opentcs.components.kernel.Scheduler.Client, java.util.Set) allocateNow()}
 * when a vehicle pops up somewhere in the driving course.
 * This usually happens either upon kernel startup or when a vehicle communicates its current
 * position to the kernel for the first time.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Once a transport order is assigned to a vehicle, the client calls
 * {@link #claim(org.opentcs.components.kernel.Scheduler.Client, java.util.List) claim()} with the
 * complete sequence of resource sets the vehicle needs to process the transport order - usually
 * each containing a point and the path leading to it.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * As the vehicle processes the transport order, the client subsequently calls
 * {@link #allocate(org.opentcs.components.kernel.Scheduler.Client, java.util.Set) allocate()} for
 * resources needed next (for reaching the next point on the route).
 * The <code>Scheduler</code> asynchronously calls back either
 * {@link Client#allocationSuccessful(java.util.Set)} or
 * {@link Client#allocationFailed(java.util.Set)}, informing the client about the result.
 * Upon allocating the resources for the client, it also implicitly removes them from the head of
 * the client's claim sequence.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * As the vehicle passes points (and paths) on the route, the client calls
 * {@link #free(org.opentcs.components.kernel.Scheduler.Client, java.util.Set) free()} for resources
 * it does not need any more, allowing these resources to be allocated by other clients.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * At the end of this process, the client's claim sequence is empty, and only the most recently
 * allocated resources are still assigned to it, reflecting the vehicle's current position.
 * (If the vehicle has disappeared from the driving course after processing the transport order, the
 * client would call {@link #freeAll(org.opentcs.components.kernel.Scheduler.Client) freeAll()} to
 * inform the <code>Scheduler</code> about this.)
 * </p>
