== The kernel's Java API

The interfaces and classes required to use the kernel API are part of the `opentcs-api-base` JAR file, so you should add that to your classpath/declare a dependency on it.
(See <<Available artifacts and API compatibility>>.)
The basic data structures for plant model components and transport orders you will encounter often are the following:

.Basic data structures
image::tcsobject_classes.png[]

The service interfaces that are most often interacted with to fetch and manipulate such data structures are these:

.TCSObject-related service interfaces
image::service_interfaces_tcsobjects.png[]

A few more interfaces are available to interact with various parts of the kernel, as shown in the following diagram:

.Additional service interfaces
image::service_interfaces_others.png[]

NOTE: _Peripheral*_ are classes/interfaces related to experimental integration of peripheral devices.
These features are not documented in detail, yet, and developers using any of them are on their own, for now.

=== Acquiring service objects

To use the services in code running inside the kernel JVM, e.g. a vehicle driver, simply request an instance of e.g. `PlantModelService` to be provided via dependency injection.
You may also work with an instance of `InternalPlantModelService` here, which provides additional methods available only to kernel application components.

To access the services from another JVM, e.g. in a client that is supposed to create transport orders or to receive status updates for transport orders or vehicles, you need to connect to them via Remote Method Invocation (RMI).
The easiest way to do this is by creating an instance of the `KernelServicePortalBuilder` class and letting it build a `KernelServicePortal` instance for you.
(For now, there isn't much support for user management, so it is recommended to ignore the methods that require user credentials.)
After creating the `KernelServicePortal` instance, you can use it to get service instances and fetch kernel events from it.
See also the class documentation for `KernelServicePortalBuilder` in the base API's JavaDoc documentation.

// XXX Move this example into a test class.

[source, java]
----
KernelServicePortal servicePortal = new KernelServicePortalBuilder().build();

// Connect and log in with a kernel somewhere.
servicePortal.login("someHost", 1099);

// Get a reference to the plant model service...
PlantModelService plantModelService = servicePortal.getPlantModelService();
// ...and find out the name of the currently loaded model.
String modelName = plantModelService.getLoadedModelName();

// Poll events, waiting up to a second if none are currently there.
// This should be done periodically, and probably in a separate thread.
List<Object> events = servicePortal.fetchEvents(1000);

=== Working with transport orders

A transport order, represented by an instance of the class `TransportOrder`, describes a process to be executed by a vehicle.
Usually, this process is an actual transport of goods from one location to another.
A `TransportOrder` may, however, also just describe a vehicle's movement to a destination position and an optional vehicle operation to be performed.

All of the following are examples for "transport orders" in openTCS, even if nothing is actually being transported:

* A classic order for transporting goods from somewhere to somewhere else:
.. Move to location "A" and perform operation "Load cargo" there.
.. Move to location "B" and perform operation "Unload cargo" there.
* Manipulation of transported or stationary goods:
.. Move to location "A" and perform operation "Drill" there.
.. Move to location "B" and perform operation "Hammer" there.
* An order to move the vehicle to a parking position:
.. Move to point "Park 01" (without performing any specific operation).
* An order to recharge the vehicle's battery:
.. Move to location "Recharge station" and perform operation "Charge battery" there.

==== A transport order's life cycle

. When a transport order is created, its initial state is `RAW`.
. A user/client sets parameters for the transport order that are supposed to influence the transport process.
  These parameters may be e.g. the transport order's deadline, the vehicle that is supposed to process the transport order or a set of generic, usually project-specific properties.
. The transport order is activated, i.e. parameter setup is finished.
  Its state is set to `ACTIVE`.
. The kernel's router checks whether routing between the transport order's destinations is possible at all.
  If yes, its state is changed to `DISPATCHABLE`.
  If routing is not possible, the transport order is marked as `UNROUTABLE` and not processed any further.
. The kernel's dispatcher checks whether all requirements for executing the transport order are fulfilled and a vehicle is available for processing it.
  As long as there are any requirements not yet fulfilled or no vehicle can execute it, the transport order is left waiting.
. The kernel's dispatcher assigns the transport order to a vehicle for processing.
  Its state is changed to `BEING_PROCESSED`.
** If a transport order that is being processed is withdrawn (by a client/user), its state first changes to `WITHDRAWN` while the vehicle executes any orders that had already been sent to it.
   Then the transport order's state changes to `FAILED`.
   It is not processed any further.
** If processing of the transport order fails for any reason, it is marked as `FAILED` and not processed any further.
** If the vehicle successfully processes the transport order as a whole, it is marked as `FINISHED`.
. Eventually -- after a longer while or when too many transport orders in a final state have accumulated in the kernel's order pool -- the kernel removes the transport order.

The following state machine visualizes this life cycle:

.Transport order states

==== Structure and processing of transport orders

.Transport order classes
image::transportorder_classes.png[]

A transport order is created by calling `TransportOrderService.createTransportOrder()`.
As its parameter, it expects an instance of `TransportOrderCreationTO` containing the sequence of destinations to visit and the operations a vehicle is supposed to perform there.
The kernel wraps each `Destination` in a newly-created `DriveOrder` instance.
These ``DriveOrder``s are themselves wrapped by the kernel in a single, newly-created `TransportOrder` instance in their given order.

Once a `TransportOrder` is being assigned to a vehicle by the `Dispatcher`, a `Route` is computed for each of its ``DriveOrder``s.
These ``Route``s are then stored in the corresponding ``DriveOrder``s.

image::transport_order_course.png[]

As soon as a vehicle (driver) is able to process a `DriveOrder`, the single ``Step``s of its `Route` are mapped to ``MovementCommand``s.
These ``MovementCommand``s contain all information the vehicle driver needs to reach the final destination and to perform the desired operation there.

.MovementCommand-related classes
image::movementcommand_classes.png[]

The ``MovementCommand``s for the partial routes to be travelled are sent to the vehicle driver bit by bit.
The kernel only sends as many ``MovementCommands``s in advance as is required for the vehicle driver to function properly.
It does this to maintain fine-grained control over the paths/resources used by all vehicles.
A vehicle driver may set the maximum number of ``MovementCommand``s it gets in advance by adjusting its command queue capacity.

As soon as a `DriveOrder` is finished, the `Route` of the next `DriveOrder` is mapped to ``MovementCommand``s.
Once the last `DriveOrder` of a `TransportOrder` is finished, the whole `TransportOrder` is finished, as well.

==== How to create a transport order

Create a list of destinations the vehicle is supposed to travel to.
Every destination is described by the name of the destination location in the plant model and an operation the vehicle is supposed to perform there:

[source, java]
----
include::{documentation-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/developers_guide/CreateTransportOrderTest.java[tags=createTransportOrder_createDestinations, indent=0]
----

Put as many destinations into the list as necessary.
Then create a transport order description with a name for the new transport order and the list of destinations.

[source, java]
----
include::{documentation-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/developers_guide/CreateTransportOrderTest.java[tags=createTransportOrder_createTransportOrderCreationTO, indent=0]
----

Optionally, express that the full name of the order should be generated by the kernel.
(If you do not do this, you need to ensure that the name of the transport order given above is unique.)

[source, java]
----
include::{documentation-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/developers_guide/CreateTransportOrderTest.java[tags=createTransportOrder_setIncompleteName, indent=0]
----

Optionally, set more parameters for the transport order, e.g. set a deadline for the order or assign a specific vehicle to it:

[source, java]
----
include::{documentation-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/developers_guide/CreateTransportOrderTest.java[tags=createTransportOrder_setMoreOptionalParameters, indent=0]
----

Get a `TransportOrderService` (see <<Acquiring service objects>>) and ask it to create a transport order using the given description:

[source, java]
----
include::{documentation-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/developers_guide/CreateTransportOrderTest.java[tags=createTransportOrder_useServiceToCreateOrder, indent=0]
----

Optionally, get a `DispatcherService` and trigger the kernel's dispatcher explicitly to have it check for a vehicle that can process the transport order.
(You only need to do this if you need the dispatcher to be triggered immediately after creating the transport order.
If you do not do this, the dispatcher will still be triggered periodically.)

[source, java]
----
include::{documentation-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/developers_guide/CreateTransportOrderTest.java[tags=createTransportOrder_triggerDispatcher, indent=0]
----

==== How to create a transport order that sends a vehicle to a point instead of a location 

Create a list containing a single destination to a point, using `Destination.OP_MOVE` as the operation to be executed:

[source, java]
----
include::{documentation-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/developers_guide/CreateTransportOrderTest.java[tags=createTransportOrderToPoint_createDestinations, indent=0]
----

Create a transport order description with a name for the new transport order and the (single-element) list of destinations:

[source, java]
----
include::{documentation-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/developers_guide/CreateTransportOrderTest.java[tags=createTransportOrderToPoint_createTransportOrderCreationTO, indent=0]
----

Get a `TransportOrderService` (see <<Acquiring service objects>>) and ask it to create a transport order using the given description:

[source, java]
----
include::{documentation-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/developers_guide/CreateTransportOrderTest.java[tags=createTransportOrderToPoint_useServiceToCreateOrder, indent=0]
----

Optionally, get a `DispatcherService` and trigger the kernel's dispatcher explicitly to have it check for a vehicle that can process the transport order.
(You only need to do this if you need the dispatcher to be triggered immediately after creating the transport order.
If you do not do this, the dispatcher will still be triggered periodically.)

[source, java]
----
include::{documentation-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/developers_guide/CreateTransportOrderTest.java[tags=createTransportOrderToPoint_triggerDispatcher, indent=0]
----

==== How to work with order sequences

An order sequence can be used to force a single vehicle to process multiple transport orders in a given order.
Some rules for using order sequences are described in the API documentation for `OrderSequence`, but here is what you would do in general.
First, create an order sequence description, providing a name:

[source, java]
----
include::{documentation-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/developers_guide/CreateTransportOrderSequenceTest.java[tags=createOrderSequence_createOrderSequenceCreationTO, indent=0]
----

Optionally, express that the full name of the sequence should be generated by the kernel.
(If you do not do this, you need to ensure that the name of the order sequence given above is unique.)

[source, java]
----
include::{documentation-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/developers_guide/CreateTransportOrderSequenceTest.java[tags=createOrderSequence_setIncompleteName, indent=0]
----

Optionally, set the sequence's failure-fatal flag:

[source, java]
----
include::{documentation-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/developers_guide/CreateTransportOrderSequenceTest.java[tags=createOrderSequence_setFailureFatal, indent=0]
----

Get a `TransportOrderService` (see <<Acquiring service objects>>) and ask it to create an order sequence using the given description:

[source, java]
----
include::{documentation-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/developers_guide/CreateTransportOrderSequenceTest.java[tags=createOrderSequence_useServiceToCreateSequence, indent=0]
----

Create a description for the transport order as usual, but set the wrapping sequence's name via `withWrappingSequence()` to associate the transport order with the order sequence.
Then, create the transport order using the `TransportOrderService`.

[source, java]
----
include::{documentation-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/developers_guide/CreateTransportOrderSequenceTest.java[tags=createOrderSequence_createTransportOrder, indent=0]
----

Create and add more orders to the order sequence as necessary.
Eventually, set the order sequence's _complete_ flag to indicate that no further transport orders will be added to it:

[source, java]
----
include::{documentation-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/developers_guide/CreateTransportOrderSequenceTest.java[tags=createOrderSequence_markSequenceComplete, indent=0]
----

As long as the sequence has not been marked as complete and finished completely, the vehicle selected for its first order will be tied to this sequence.
It will not process any orders not belonging to the same sequence until the whole sequence has been finished.

Once the _complete_ flag of the sequence has been set and all transport orders belonging to it have been processed, its _finished_ flag will be set by the kernel.

==== How to withdraw a transport order

To withdraw a transport order, get a `DispatcherService` (see <<Acquiring service objects>>) and ask it to withdraw the order, providing a reference to it:

[source, java]
----
include::{documentation-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/developers_guide/WithdrawTransportOrderTest.java[tags=documentation_withdrawTransportOrder, indent=0]
----

The second argument indicates whether the vehicle should finish the movements it is already assigned to (`false`) or abort immediately (`true`).

==== How to withdraw a transport order via a vehicle reference

To withdraw the transport order that a specific vehicle is currently processing, get a `DispatcherService` (see <<Acquiring service objects>>) and ask it to withdraw the order, providing a reference to the vehicle:

[source, java]
----
include::{documentation-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/developers_guide/WithdrawTransportOrderTest.java[tags=documentation_withdrawTransportOrderByVehicle, indent=0]
----

The second argument indicates whether the vehicle should finish the movements it is already assigned to (`false`) or abort immediately (`true`).

=== Using the event bus

Each of the main openTCS applications -- Kernel, Kernel Control Center, Model Editor and Operations Desk -- provides an event bus that can be used to receive or emit event objects application-wide.
To acquire the respective application's event bus instance, request it to be provided via dependency injection.
Any of the following three variants of constructor parameters are equivalent:

[source, java]
----
public MyClass(@ApplicationEventBus EventHandler eventHandler) {
  ...
}
----

[source, java]
----
public MyClass(@ApplicationEventBus EventSource eventSource) {
  ...
}
----

[source, java]
----
public MyClass(@ApplicationEventBus EventBus eventBus) {
  ...
}
----

Having acquired the `EventHandler`, `EventSource` or `EventBus` instance that way, you can use it to emit event objects to it and/or subscribe to receive event objects.

Note that, within the Kernel application, event objects should be emitted via the kernel executor to avoid concurrency issues -- see <<section-kernel-executor>>.
