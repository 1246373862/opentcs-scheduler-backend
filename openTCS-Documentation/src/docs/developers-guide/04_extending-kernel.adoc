== Customizing and extending the kernel application

=== Guice modules

The openTCS kernel application uses Guice to configure its components.
To modify the wiring of components within the application and to add your own components, you can register custom Guice modules.
Modules are found and registered automatically via `java.util.ServiceLoader`.

Basically, the following steps are required for customizing the application:

. Build a JAR file for your custom injection module with the following content:
.. A subclass of `org.opentcs.customizations.kernel.KernelInjectionModule`, which can be found in the base library, must be contained.
Configure your custom components or adjust the application's default wiring in this module.
`KernelInjectionModule` provides a few supporting methods you can use.
.. A plain text file named `META-INF/services/org.opentcs.customizations.kernel.KernelInjectionModule` must also be contained.
This file should contain a single line of text with the fully qualified class name of your module.
. Ensure that the JAR file(s) containing your Guice modules and the implementation of your custom component(s) are part of the class path when you start the kernel application.

For more information on how the automatic registration works, see the documentation of `java.util.ServiceLoader` in the Java class library.
For more information on how Guice works, see the Guice documentation.

=== Replacing default kernel components

The kernel application comes with default implementations for the dispatching, routing and scheduling components.
These default implementations allow the kernel to fulfil all of its responsibilities, but specific use cases might make it necessary to replace them with custom ones.
In such cases, they can be replaced with a custom Guice configuration.

For each of these components, `KernelInjectionModule` provides a convenience method for (re)binding the implementation.
To replace e.g. the default `Dispatcher` implementation, simply register a Guice module in which you call `bindDispatcher()`.
The module's implementation could look like this:

[source, java]
----
@Override
protected void configure() {
  configureSomeDispatcherDependencies();
  bindDispatcher(CustomDispatcher.class);
}
----

IMPORTANT: Note that all component implementations are bound as singletons.
This is important for the following reason:
Components may be injected and used at multiple places within the kernel application; at the same time, every component may also have to keep an internal state to do its work.
If they were not bound as singletons, a new instance would be created for every injection, each of them with their own, separate internal state.
Build custom components with that in mind, and implement their `initialize()` and `terminate()` methods appropriately!

=== Developing vehicle drivers

openTCS supports integration of custom vehicle drivers that implement vehicle-specific communication protocols and thus mediate between the kernel and the vehicle.
Due to its function, a vehicle driver is also called a communication adapter.
The following sections describe which requirements must be met by a driver and which steps are necessary to create and use it.

==== Classes and interfaces for the kernel

.Classes of a comm adapter implementation (kernel side)
image::commadapter_classes_kernel.png[]

When developing a vehicle driver, the most important classes and interfaces in the base library are the following:

* `VehicleCommAdapter` declares methods that every comm adapter must implement.
  These methods are called by components within the kernel, for instance to tell a vehicle that it is supposed to move to the next position in the driving course.
  Classes implementing this interface are expected to perform the actual communication with a vehicle, e.g. via TCP, UDP or some field bus.
* `BasicVehicleCommAdapter` is the recommended base class for implementing a `VehicleCommAdapter`.
  It primarily provides some basic command queueing.
* `VehicleCommAdapterFactory` describes a factory for `VehicleCommAdapter` instances.
  The kernel instantiates and uses one such factory per vehicle driver to create instances of the respective `VehicleCommAdapter` implementation on demand.
* A single `VehicleProcessModel` instance should be provided by every `VehicleCommAdapter` instance in which it keeps the relevant state of both the vehicle and the comm adapter.
  This model instance is supposed to be updated to notify the kernel about relevant changes.
  The comm adapter implementation should e.g. update the vehicle's current position in the model when it receives that information to allow the kernel and GUI frontends to use it.
  Likewise, other components may set values that influence the comm adapter's behaviour in the model, e.g. a time interval for periodic messages the comm adapter sends to the vehicle.
  `VehicleProcessModel` may be used as it is, as it contains members for all the information the openTCS kernel itself needs.
  However, developers may use driver-specific subclasses of `VehicleProcessModel` to have the comm adapter and other components exchange more than the default set of attributes.

==== Classes and interfaces for the control center application

For the kernel control center application, the following interfaces and classes are the most important ones:

.Classes of a comm adapter implementation (kernel control center side)
image::commadapter_classes_kcc.png[]

* `VehicleCommAdapterPanel` instances may be created by a `VehicleCommAdapterPanelFactory` e.g. to display information about the associated vehicle or send low-level messages to it.
* `VehicleProcessModelTO` instances should be provided by every `VehicleCommAdapter` instance according to the current state of its `VehicleProcessModel`.
  Instances of this model are supposed to be used in a comm adapter's `VehicleCommAdapterPanel` instances for updating their contents only.
  Note that `VehicleProcessModelTO` is basically a serializable representation of a comm adapter's `VehicleProcessModel`.
  Developers should keep that in mind when creating driver-specific subclasses of `VehicleProcessModelTO`.
* Instances of `VehicleCommAdapterDescription` provide a string describing/identifying the comm adapter implementation.
  This string is shown e.g. when the user may select one of a set of driver implementations and should thus be unique.
  It is also used for attaching a comm adapter implementation via `VehicleService.attachCommAdapter()`.
* `AdapterCommand` instances can be sent from a panel to a `VehicleCommAdapter` instance via `VehicleService.sendCommAdapterCommand()`.
  They are supposed to be executed by the comm adapter and can be used to execute arbitrary methods, e.g. methods of the `VehicleCommAdapter` itself, or update contents of the comm adapter's `VehicleProcessModel`.
  Note that `AdapterCommand` instances can only be sent to and processed by the kernel application if they are serializable and present in the kernel application's classpath.

==== Steps to create a new vehicle driver

. Create an implementation of `VehicleCommAdapter`:
.. Subclass `BasicVehicleCommAdapter` unless you have a reason not to.
   You don't have to, but if you don't, you also need to implement command queue management yourself.
.. Implement the abstract methods of `BasicVehicleCommAdapter` in the derived class to realize communication with the vehicle.
.. In situations in which the state of the vehicle changes in a way that is relevant for the kernel or the comm adapter's custom panels, the comm adapter should call the respective methods on the model.
   Most importantly, call `setVehiclePosition()` and `commandExecuted()` on the comm adapter's model when the controlled vehicle's reported state indicates that it has moved to a different position or that it has finished an order.
. Create an implementation of `VehicleCommAdapterFactory` that provides instances of your `VehicleCommAdapter` for given `Vehicle` objects.
. Optional: Create any number of implementations of `VehicleCommAdapterPanel` that the kernel control center application should display for the comm adapter.
  Create and return instances of these panels in the `getPanelsFor()` method of your ``VehicleCommAdapterPanelFactory``s implementation.

See the API documentation for more details.
For an example, refer to the implementation of the loopback comm adapter for virtual vehicles in the openTCS source distribution.
(Note, however, that this implementation does not implement communication with any physical vehicle.)

==== Registering a vehicle driver with the kernel

. Create a Guice module for your vehicle driver by creating a subclass of `KernelInjectionModule`.
Implement the `configure()` method and register a binding to your `VehicleCommAdapterFactory`.
For example, the loopback driver that is part of the openTCS distribution registers its own factory class with the following line in its `configure()` method:
+
[source, java]
----
include::{loopback-guiceSrc}/org/opentcs/virtualvehicle/LoopbackCommAdapterModule.java[tags=documentation_createCommAdapterModule]
----

. In the JAR file containing your driver, ensure that there exists a folder named `META-INF/services/` with a file named `org.opentcs.customizations.kernel.KernelInjectionModule`.
This file should consist of a single line of text holding simply the name of the Guice module class, e.g.:
+
[source]
----
org.opentcs.virtualvehicle.LoopbackCommAdapterModule
----
NOTE: Background: openTCS uses `java.util.ServiceLoader` to automatically find Guice modules on startup, which depends on this file (with this name) being present.
See the JDK's API documentation for more information about how this mechanism works.
. Place the JAR file of your driver including all neccessary resources in the subdirectory `lib/openTCS-extensions/` of the openTCS kernel application's installation directory _before_ the kernel is started.
(The openTCS start scripts include all JAR files in that directory in the application's classpath.)

Drivers meeting these requirements are found automatically when you start the kernel.

=== Sending messages to communication adapters

Sometimes it is required to have some influence on the behaviour of a communication adapter (and thus the vehicle it is associated with) directly from a kernel client - to send a special telegram to the vehicle, for instance.
For these cases, `VehicleService.sendCommAdapterMessage(TCSObjectReference<Vehicle>, Object)` provides a one-way communication channel for a client to send a message object to a communication adapter currently associated with a vehicle.
A comm adapter implementing `processMessage()` may interpret message objects sent to it and react in an appropriate way.
Note that the client sending the message may not know which communication adapter implementation is currently associated with the vehicle, so the adapter may or may not be able to understand the message.

=== Acquiring data from communication adapters

For getting information from a communication adapter to a kernel client, there are the following ways:

Communication adapters may publish events via their `VehicleProcessModel` instance to emit information encapsulated in an event for any listeners registered with the kernel.
Apparently, listeners must already be registered before such an event is emitted by the communication adapter, or they will miss it.
To register a client as a listener, use `EventSource.subscribe()`.
You can get the `EventSource` instance used by the kernel through dependency injection by using the qualifier annotation `ApplicationEventBus`.

Alternatively, communication adapters may use their `VehicleProcessModel` to set properties in the corresponding `Vehicle` object.
Kernel clients may then retrieve the information from it:

[source, java]
----
include::{documentation-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/developers_guide/ReceiveCommAdapterMessageTest.java[tags=documentation_receiveMessageFromVehicle, indent=0]
----

Communication adapters may also use their `VehicleProcessModel` to set properties in the corresponding `TransportOrder` object a vehicle is currently processing.
This basically works the same way as with the `Vehicle` object:

[source, java]
----
include::{documentation-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/developers_guide/ReceiveCommAdapterMessageTest.java[tags=documentation_receiveMessageFromTransportOrder, indent=0]
----

Unlike information published via events, data stored as properties in `Vehicle` or `TransportOrder` objects can be retrieved at any time.

=== Developing peripheral drivers

In addition to vehicle drivers, openTCS supports the integration of custom peripheral drivers that implement peripheral-specific communication protocols and thus mediate between the kernel and the peripheral device.
In openTCS, a peripheral device is a device a vehicle may interact with along its route, e.g. an elevator or a fire door.
Due to its function, a peripheral driver is also called a peripheral communication adapter.
The following sections describe which requirements must be met by a driver and which steps are necessary to create and use it.

==== Classes and interfaces for the kernel

.Classes of a peripheral comm adapter implementation (kernel side)
image::peripheral_commadapter_classes_kernel.png[]

When developing a peripheral driver, the most important classes and interfaces in the base library are the following:

* `PeripheralCommAdapter` declares methods that every comm adapter must implement.
  These methods are called by components within the kernel, for instance to tell a peripheral device that it is supposed to perform an operation, e.g. for an elevator to move to a specific floor.
  Classes implementing this interface are expected to perform the actual communication with a peripheral device, e.g. via TCP, UDP or some field bus.
* `BasicPeripheralCommAdapter` is the recommended base class for implementing a `PeripheralCommAdapter`.
  It primarily provides some basic event dispatching with regards to the `PeripheralProcessModel`.
* `PeripheralCommAdapterFactory` describes a factory for `PeripheralCommAdapter` instances.
  The kernel instantiates and uses one such factory per peripheral driver to create instances of the respective `PeripheralCommAdapter` implementation on demand.
* A single `PeripheralProcessModel` instance should be provided by every `PeripheralCommAdapter` instance in which it keeps the relevant state of both the peripheral device and the comm adapter.
  This model instance is supposed to be updated to notify the kernel about relevant changes.
  The comm adapter implementation should e.g. update the peripheral device's current state in the model when it receives that information to allow the kernel and GUI frontends to use it.
  `PeripheralProcessModel` may be used as it is, as it contains members for all the information the openTCS kernel itself needs.
  However, developers may use driver-specific subclasses of `PeripheralProcessModel` to have the comm adapter and other components exchange more than the default set of attributes.

==== Classes and interfaces for the control center application

For the kernel control center application, the following classes and interfaces are the most important:

.Classes of a peripheral comm adapter implementation (kernel control center side)
image::peripheral_commadapter_classes_kcc.png[]

* `PeripheralCommAdapterPanel` instances may be created by a `PeripheralCommAdapterPanelFactory` e.g. to display information about the associated peripheral device or send low-level messages to it.
* `PeripheralProcessModel` instances are used in a comm adapter's `PeripheralCommAdapterPanel` instances for updating their contents.
  In contrast to a `VehicleCommAdapter`, there is no class such as `PeripheralProcessModelTO`, since `PeripheralProcessModel` already implements the `Serializable` interface.
  Developers should keep that in mind when creating driver-specific subclasses of `PeripheralProcessModel`.
* Instances of `PeripheralCommAdapterDescription` provide a string describing/identifying the comm adapter implementation.
  This string is shown e.g. when the user may select one of a set of driver implementations and should thus be unique.
  It is also used for attaching a comm adapter implementation via `PeripheralService.attachCommAdapter()`.
* `PeripheralAdapterCommand` instances can be sent from a panel to a `PeripheralCommAdapter` instance via `PeripheralService.sendCommAdapterCommand()`.
  They are supposed to be executed by the comm adapter and can be used to execute arbitrary methods, e.g. methods of the `PeripheralCommAdapter` itself, or update contents of the comm adapter's `PeripheralProcessModel`.
  Note that `PeripheralAdapterCommand` instances can only be sent to and processed by the kernel application if they are serializable and present in the kernel application's classpath.

==== Steps to create a new peripheral driver

. Create an implementation of `PeripheralCommAdapter`:
.. Subclass `BasicPeripheralCommAdapter` unless you have a reason not to.
.. Implement the abstract methods of `BasicPeripheralCommAdapter` in the derived class to realize communication with the peripheral device.
.. In situations in which the state of the peripheral device changes in a way that is relevant for the kernel or the comm adapter's custom panels, the comm adapter should call the respective methods on the model and publish a corresponding `PeripheralProcessModelEvent` via the kernel's `ApplicationEventBus`.   
   Most importantly, call `PeripheralJobCallback.peripheralJobFinished()` on the callback instance provided with `PeripheralCommAdapter.process()` when the controlled peripheral device's reported state indicates that it has finished a job.
. Create an implementation of `PeripheralCommAdapterFactory` that provides instances of your `PeripheralCommAdapter` for given `Location` objects.
. Optional: Create any number of implementations of `PeripheralCommAdapterPanel` that the kernel control center application should display for the comm adapter.
  Create and return instances of these panels in the `getPanelsFor()` method of your ``PeripheralCommAdapterPanelFactory``s implementation.

See the API documentation for more details.
For an example, refer to the implementation of the loopback peripheral comm adapter for virtual peripheral devices in the openTCS source distribution.
(Note, however, that this implementation does not implement communication with any physical peripheral device.)

==== Registering a peripheral driver with the kernel

. Create a Guice module for your peripheral driver by creating a subclass of `KernelInjectionModule`.
Implement the `configure()` method and register a binding to your `PeripheralCommAdapterFactory`.
For example, the peripheral loopback driver that is part of the openTCS distribution registers its own factory class with the following line in its `configure()` method:
+
[source, java]
----
include::{peripheral-loopback-guiceSrc}/org/opentcs/commadapter/peripheral/loopback/LoopbackPeripheralKernelModule.java[tags=documentation_createCommAdapterModule]
----

. In the JAR file containing your driver, ensure that there exists a folder named `META-INF/services/` with a file named `org.opentcs.customizations.kernel.KernelInjectionModule`.
This file should consist of a single line of text holding simply the name of the Guice module class, e.g.:
+
[source]
----
org.opentcs.commadapter.peripheral.loopback.LoopbackPeripheralKernelModule
----
NOTE: Background: openTCS uses `java.util.ServiceLoader` to automatically find Guice modules on startup, which depends on this file (with this name) being present.
See the JDK's API documentation for more information about how this mechanism works.
. Place the JAR file of your driver including all neccessary resources in the subdirectory `lib/openTCS-extensions/` of the openTCS kernel application's installation directory _before_ the kernel is started.
(The openTCS start scripts include all JAR files in that directory in the application's classpath.)

Drivers meeting these requirements are found automatically when you start the kernel.

[#section-kernel-executor]
=== Executing code in kernel context

Within the kernel, concurrent modifications of the data model -- e.g. contents of the plant model or transport order properties -- need to be synchronized carefully.
Similar to e.g. the Swing framework's Event Dispatcher Thread, a single thread is used for executing one-shot or periodics tasks performing data modifications.
To help with this, an instance of `java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService` is provided.
Custom code running within the kernel application, including vehicle drivers and implementations of additional funcionality, should also perform changes of the data model via this executor only to avoid concurrency issues.

To make use of the kernel's executor, use the `@KernelExecutor` qualifier annotation and inject a `ScheduledExecutorService`:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
public MyClass(@KernelExecutor ScheduledExecutorService kernelExecutor) {
  ...
}
----

You can also inject it as a `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService`:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
public MyClass(@KernelExecutor ExecutorService kernelExecutor) {
  ...
}
----

Injecting a `java.util.concurrent.Executor` is also possible:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
public MyClass(@KernelExecutor Executor kernelExecutor) {
  ...
}
----

Then, you can use it e.g. to lock a path in the plant model in kernel context:

[source, java]
----
kernelExecutor.submit(() -> routerService.updatePathLock(ref, true));
----

Due to the single-threaded nature of the kernel executor, tasks submitted to it are executed sequentially, one after another.
This implies that submitting long-running tasks should be avoided, as they would block the execution of subsequent tasks.

When event objects, e.g. instances of `TCSObjectEvent`, are distributed within the kernel, this always happens in kernel context, i.e. from a task that is run by the kernel executor.
Event handlers should behave accordingly and finish quickly/not block execution for too long.
If processing an event requires time-consuming actions to be taken, these should be executed on a different thread.

NOTE: As its name indicates, the kernel executor is only available within the kernel application.
It is not available for code running in other applications like the Operations Desk, and it is not required there (for avoiding concurrency issues in the kernel).
